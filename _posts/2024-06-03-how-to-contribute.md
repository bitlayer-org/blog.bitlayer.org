How to contribute to this blog site.

## Things to do

- Add new markdown file to _posts folder. Naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title-is-here.md` example: `2018-06-12-powerful-things-markdown-editor.md`
- Put all images into assets/images/, including a head image used as thumbnail of the article. Image naming convention: generate a UUID with uuidgen command. Example: `9B7674B1-5B2F-49DB-99A9-95A112D2766F.png`
- Contact our designer colleague to make the head image for you. The head image makes your article feel more professional.
